### Github Finder: jQuery & Ajax

Build a JavaScript/jQuery application that fetches and displays Github user profile info and repositories using Ajax.

However, to keep it simple I did not use `client_id` or `client_secret` with the ajax requests. So
the number of ajax requests permitted are very limited.

#### Tools
- Jquery
- Ajax
- [Bootstwatch Bootstrap United Theme](https://bootswatch.com/united/)
